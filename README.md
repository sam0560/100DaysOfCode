<b>HTML INTRODUCTION</b><br>
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language.

It is a combination of Hypertext and Markup.
- Hypertext defines the link between web pages
- A markup language defines the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.

HTML PAGE STRUCTURE

<!DOCTYPE html>�� This is the document type declaration (not technically a tag). It declares a document as being an HTML document. The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive.

<html>�� This is called the HTML root element. All other elements are contained within it.

<head>�� The head tag contains the �behind the scenes� elements for a webpage. Elements within the head aren�t visible on the front-end of a webpage. HTML elements used inside the <head> element include:�
* <title>�� The title is what is displayed on the top of your browser when you visit a website and contains the title of the webpage that you are viewing. Document

* <meta>�� This tag encloses the meta data of the website that must be loaded every time the website is visited. For eg:- the metadata charset allows you to use the standard UTF-8 encoding in your website. This in turn allows the users to view your webpage in the language of their choice. It is a self closing tag.

* <body>�� The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the browser will show on the front-end.

An HTML document can be created using any text editor. Save the text file using�.html�or�.htm. Once saved as an HTML document, the file can be opened as a webpage in the browser.
