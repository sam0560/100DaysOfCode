<b>HTML Introduction</b><br>
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language.

It is a combination of Hypertext and Markup.
- Hypertext defines the link between web pages
- A markup language defines the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.

`<!DOCTYPE html>` This is the document type declaration (not technically a tag). It declares a document as being an HTML document. The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive.

`<html>` This is called the HTML root element. All other elements are contained within it.

`<head>` The head tag contains the behind the scenes elements for a webpage. Elements within the head aren't visible on the front-end of a webpage. HTML elements used inside the <head> element include:
* `<title>` The title is what is displayed on the top of your browser when you visit a website and contains the title of the webpage that you are viewing. Document

* `<meta>` This tag encloses the meta data of the website that must be loaded every time the website is visited. For eg:- the metadata charset allows you to use the standard UTF-8 encoding in your website. This in turn allows the users to view your webpage in the language of their choice. It is a self closing tag.

* `<body>` The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the browser will show on the front-end.

An HTML document can be created using any text editor. Save the text file using `.html` or `.htm`. Once saved as an HTML document, the file can be opened as a webpage in the browser.

The HTML heading tag is used to define the headings of a page. There are six levels of headings defined by HTML. These 6 heading elements are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6; with h1 being the highest level and h6 being the least.

`<!-- Heading -->
    <h1>This is Heading 1</h1>

<b>HTML Paragraphs</b><br>
The `<p>` tag in HTML defines a paragraph. These have both opening and closing tags. So anything mentioned within `<p>` and `</p>` is treated as a paragraph.
<br>

it is used to declare inline styling for HTML elements

Use for inserting horizontal rule into document. <br>
<br>
